I had alot of work done but realizied i failed to open the repository and was coding within the the wrong file and folder.  I had to transfer all the code to a correct file set up.

I am creating a word scramble game. I want to see if theres an API aviable that will provided list of words and hints from the internet in stead of a set load of information.
